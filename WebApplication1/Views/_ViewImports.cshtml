@*_ViewImports.cshtml serves one major purpose: to provide namespaces which can be used by all other views.*@

@*All the files that we import in this file, will be available to all subfiles within this folder
    i.e. all the views within the Views folder *@
@using WebApplication1.Models;
@using WebApplication1.ViewModels;




@*What are Tag Helpers?
    Tag Helpers enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files.
    For example, the built-in ImageTagHelper can append a version number to the image name. Whenever the image
    changes, the server generates a new unique version for the image, so clients are guaranteed to get the
    current image (instead of a stale cached image). There are many built-in Tag Helpers for common tasks
    - such as creating forms, links, loading assets and more - and even more available in public GitHub
    repositories and as NuGet packages. Tag Helpers are authored in C#, and they target HTML elements
    based on element name, attribute name, or parent tag.*@


@*The @addTagHelper directive makes Tag Helpers available to the view. In this case, the view file
    is Views/_ViewImports.cshtml, which by default is inherited by all view files in the Views folder
    and sub-directories; making Tag Helpers available. The code above uses the wildcard syntax (" * ")
    to specify that all Tag Helpers in the specified assembly (Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers) will
    be available to every view file in the Views directory or sub-directory. The first parameter after
    @addTagHelper specifies the Tag Helpers to load (we are using " * " for all Tag Helpers), and the
    second parameter "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers" specifies the assembly containing the Tag Helpers.
    Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers is the assembly for the built-in ASP.NET Core Tag Helpers.*@
